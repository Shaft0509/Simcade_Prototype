## Overview
We are making a prototype that combines Pool and Mini-Golf that uses real-world Pool physics.

#### Objective Statement
> Can a high speed driving game benefit from having a physics system and be entertaining?

We're curious to see if having a big focus on physics for a fast, more arcadey driving game can work as a fun factor for the player while also staying understandable (not being too chaotic to the point of the player losing sense of what's happening).

#### Intended Expeience
Our hope for the player's experience is to feel the intense speed of the car down the highway while trying to keep from crashing against the walls. They would be expected to maintain their high speed and keep control of the car simultaneously.

#### Design Rationale
For a full game, we planned for a high speed driving game down an endless highway. While not being considered to add to the current prototype, we would plan to have cars driving at slower speeds than the players along with and against the player, as well as potential ramps on certain cars for score bonuses.
The car physics in this prototype would be exagerated compare to that of a real car, and would only take driving, drifting, and colliding with walls at this time.

## Playtest
We had a playtest of our prototype to get feedback that we could incorporate into the final version of the prototype. For the playtest, we didn't have too much to show for and new of some issues that would be addressed already, but had valuable feedback that can broken down to:
* Camera stutters and struggles following the car
* Awkward control scheme
* No collision
* Add different shot powers and UI to accomodate

What feedback we added

All this feedback received was what made The drove be ultimately working and possible!
