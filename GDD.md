## Overview
We are making a prototype for a physics based driving game, where the player would need to drive at high speeds down a highway, reach the goal before the timer runs out, and try to avoid driving into obstacles.

### Objective Statement
> Can a high speed driving game benefit from having a physics system and be entertaining?

We're curious to see if having a big focus on physics for a fast, more arcadey driving game can work as a fun factor for the player while also staying understandable (not being too chaotic to the point of the player losing sense of what's happening).

### Intended Expeience
Our hope for the player's experience is to feel the intense speed of the car down the highway while trying to keep from crashing against the walls. They would be expected to maintain their high speed and keep control of the car simultaneously.

### Design Rationale
For a full game, we planned for a high speed driving game down an endless highway. While not being considered to add to the current prototype, we would plan to have cars driving at slower speeds than the players along with and against the player, as well as potential ramps on certain cars for score bonuses. The car physics in this prototype would be exagerated compare to that of a real car, and would only take driving, drifting, and colliding with walls at this time.

## Playtest
We had a playtest of our prototype to get feedback that we could incorporate into the final version of the prototype. For the playtest, we didn't have too much to show for and knew of some issues that would be addressed already, but had valuable feedback that can broken down to:
* Camera stutters and struggles following the car
* Awkward control scheme
* No collision
* Floating car
* Wild car movements

Upon finishing the final build of the prototype, we were able to fix the camera following, added collision which also stopped the car from floating, and changed the control sceme to a more standard system. As for the wild car movement, we decided on keeping it the way it is now that collision was added, making it part of the experience. All the feedback received was what made The Drove possible and ultimately working!
